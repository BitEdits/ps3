Installing Rebug 4.86 (or Any CFW) Using 3.55 Keys

This process applies to fully hackable PS3 models (CECH-25XX or older)
and leverages the 3.55 private keys to install custom firmware.

Step 1: Understanding the Role of 3.55 Keys

* Sony signs firmware updates with private keys, which ensure only official firmware (OFW) can be installed.
* The 3.55 keys were leaked, allowing custom firmware (CFW) to be signed in a way that the PS3 accepts as "legit."
* However, later firmware (like 4.86) uses stronger encryption, so direct installation is blocked.

Step 2: Downgrading to 3.55 (If Needed)

* Option 1: Use a hardware flasher (E3 Flasher, Teensy, Progskeet) to downgrade to 3.55.
* Option 2: If on OFW 4.82 â€“ 4.90, use PS3Xploit to install a hybrid firmware (HFW) and enable Flash Writer to allow CFW installation.

Step 3: Patching the Core OS (Using 3.55 Keys)

* Official PS3 firmware updates are encrypted and signed using Sony's private keys.
* CFW developers (like Rebug) decrypt the firmware using known keys (3.55) and re-sign it with the same keys, allowing it to be installed on any PS3 that accepts 3.55-signed packages.
* Tools like scetool, fail0verflow's tools, or MFW Builder can be used to manually patch the firmware.
* CoreOS, lv1/lv2 (Hypervisor & Kernel), and selfs (executables) are modified to allow: 1) Homebrew execution; 2) Disabling signature checks; 3) Debugging/developer tools (DEX).

Step 4: Installing Rebug 4.86 via the PS3 Recovery Menu

* Download Rebug 4.86.1 CFW (.PUP file).
* Format a USB drive to FAT32 and create a folder
* Place the Rebug .PUP file inside and rename it to PS3UPDAT.PUP
* Boot the PS3 into Recovery Mode (Safe Mode).
  Turn off the PS3, then hold the power button until it turns off.
  Hold the power button again until you hear two beeps, then release.
* Select System Update and install the Rebug firmware.

Step 5: Verifying the Installation & Unlocking Full Features

* After the install, the PS3 will boot into Rebug CFW.
* To enable full debugging tools, install Rebug Toolbox.
* Optional: Enable Cobra Mode for extra features (ISO loading, PSP/PS2 support).
* Now, homebrew and backup managers (like Multiman or Webman) can be installed.
